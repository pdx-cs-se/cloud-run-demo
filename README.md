# cloud-run-demo: Google Cloud Run demo
Bart Massey

This repo contains the artifacts of my experience setting up
and running the official Google Cloud Run demo. The only
interesting file is probably `transcript.txt`, which is a
terminal log of my session doing this stuff.

By the time you read this, I will have taken down my demo
instance located at the URL in the file `helloworld.url` to
avoid racking up accesses; I would suggest running through
the fine demo yourself.
